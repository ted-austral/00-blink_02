#       Project 01-blink_02

##      Hardware

        ESP32 development board
        Tact switch
        White high intensity LED
        220 ohm resistor
        Jumper wire
        Filter capacitor

##      Connections

        From GND on ESP32 development board to negative rail - (blue one) on one side of protoboard
        From GND and from 3V3 on ESP32 development board to both negative (blue) and positive rails of another side

        From GPIO27 to one terminal of resistor 220 ohm
        From other terminal of resistor to LED anode
        From LED cathode to negative (blue) RAIL

        From GPIO18 to one side of Tact switch
        From the other side of Tact switch to positive (red) rail

        Between both power supply rails (red and blue, a capacitor in order to filter 3V3 power supply
